        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            
            My name is Travis Guiley. I'm currently the owner of a small retail
            business that sells card games and board games. I graduated from Eastern
            University in Cheney, WA with a bachelor's degree in Finance and Management Info Systems
            with a minor in Economics. For the first 7 years of my career I worked as 
            a business/financial analyst. I then decided to follow a passion of mine and 
            open a retail game store, but running a small business is never easy. You can plan 
            all you like, but something will always go wrong. It has been a wonderful experience
            and I learned a lot, but it became time to try something different.

            As an analyst, I became an Excel Guru. No matter how far I got in my career there was always 
            someone who "just wanted a spreadsheet." As our team capabilities evolved with the times, 
            spreadsheets became one of the most frustrating parts of my job. We had brought Google BigQuery 
            online and the amount of data we had at our fingertips was astounding. Coupled with tools like 
            Tableau we could take all that data and every single day you could go in and see how your previous day 
            performed without even having to send an email. But still, there was always someone that wanted a spreadsheet.

            Since I couldn't get away from the spreadsheets, I did the next best thing. I spent a whole lot of time working 
            in SQL. The spreadsheets could not handle the raw data, there was just too much. Between the need for 
            spreadsheets to have smaller datasets, and all the new Tableau dashboards we were building, I got pretty good at 
            SQL. It became the favorite part of my job. Just like any programmer would, I spent a lot of time scowling at 
            my screen, searching StackOverflow forums, and when all else failed running over to our Advanced Analytics team 
            (the team that build our BigQuery tables). But I loved every minute of it. I could get absolutely lost in the code. 
            I love a good puzzle, and every new query was the latest puzzle to solve.

            I've moved from Eagle River, Alaska to Spokane, Washington (wasn't far enough south) to Las Vegas, NV and have seen more 
            of the world already at 35 than some people ever will in their entire lives. I've been to 15 countries and 16 different
            states within the US searching for where I want to live and for the answer to the famous "want do you want to be when you 
            grow up" question. I might not yet know where I want to live forever, but I'm confident I've finally figured out the 
            answer to that famous question. I want to write code. It can be games, websites, or applications. Android or Windows 
            or the next greatest thing it doesn't matter. I just want to solve my next puzzle.
